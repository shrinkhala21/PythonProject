      <h1 class="display-3">SHOPAHOLIC</h1>
      <p>SHOPAHOLIC is an Indian e-commerce company based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It was founded by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal in 2007. The company initially focused on book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials & groceries, and lifestyle products.

The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[8][9] As of March 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry. SHOPAHOLIC is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisition of SHOPAHOLIC), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones. SHOPAHOLIC also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).SHOPAHOLIC is a one stop shop for all your fashion and lifestyle needs. Being India's largest e-commerce store for fashion and lifestyle products, SHOPAHOLIC aims at providing a hassle free and enjoyable shopping experience to shoppers across the country with the widest range of brands and products on its portal. The brand is making a conscious effort to bring the power of fashion to shoppers with an array of the latest and trendiest products available in the country.

In August 2018, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 81% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16 billion, valuing it at $20 billion.</p>
